# Automatic Crit and Fumble Tables
This extension automates use of Pathfinder's crit and fumble tables.
It requires use of my [Critical and Fumble Decks](https://github.com/FG-Unofficial-Developers-Guild/FG-PFRPG-Critical-and-Fumble-Deck) module (or another module with the same table names). Detection of spells requires use of either [my Pathfinder-compatible port of the Advanced Effects extension](https://github.com/FG-Unofficial-Developers-Guild/FG-PFRPG-Advanced-Effects) or Kelrugem's [Extended Automation extension](https://github.com/FG-Unofficial-Developers-Guild/Extended-automation-and-overlays).

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.2.2 (2022-06-07).

This extension works with the 3.5E and PFRPG rulesets.
